# Arduino Object Counter

This project involves an Arduino hooked up to a light sensor. When an object passes by the light sensor the Arduino sends a serial command to the java GUI which displays the amount of object passes there are. The main goal for this project is to deliver a solution that can give real-time feed back for an industrial conveyor belt, updating an API so that services can be improved.

Here is a screenshot of the solution:
